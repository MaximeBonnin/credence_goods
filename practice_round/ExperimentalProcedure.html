{% if participant.is_expert %}
<p>Each round follows the same basic sequence of decisions. Be mindful that you need 
    to understand both roles in order to answer the comprehension questions and make 
    sensible decisions that determine your final bonus payoff.</p>

<p>Each round, clients receive either a big problem with a probability of x%, 
    or a small problem with a probability of y%. Clients will never be informed 
    about which problem they actually have. In order to solve the problem, a client 
    needs to approach an expert. Alternatively, each client can also choose not to 
    enter the market, and avoid interaction with an expert. If a client decides to 
    enter the market, he or she can choose one of z experts. If the chosen expert 
    successfully solves the client’s problem, the client receives 150 Coins for that 
    round. If the problem is not solved, the client does not receive anything. 
    Irrespective of the outcome, the client has to pay the price chosen by the expert. 
    All prices by each expert and their respective ability level are visible to the 
    client when deciding which expert to approach.</p>

<p>Each round, the expert’s (your) job is to diagnose the client’s problem and treat 
    them. You can either choose a low-quality treatment, or a high-quality treatment. 
    The low-quality treatment only solves the small problem of the client. The high-quality 
    treatment solves both the small problem and the big problem. You always have to pay 
    X Coins for the low-quality treatment, and Y Coins for the high-quality treatment.</p>
