{% if participant.is_expert %}
<p>Each round follows the same basic sequence of decisions. Be mindful that you need 
    to understand both roles in order to answer the comprehension questions and make 
    sensible decisions that determine your final bonus payoff.</p>

<p>Each round, clients receive either a big problem with a probability of x%, 
    or a small problem with a probability of y%. Clients will never be informed 
    about which problem they actually have. In order to solve the problem, a client 
    needs to approach an expert. Alternatively, each client can also choose not to 
    enter the market, and avoid interaction with an expert. If a client decides to 
    enter the market, he or she can choose one of z experts. If the chosen expert 
    successfully solves the client’s problem, the client receives 150 Coins for that 
    round. If the problem is not solved, the client does not receive anything. 
    Irrespective of the outcome, the client has to pay the price chosen by the expert. 
    All prices by each expert and their respective ability level are visible to the 
    client when deciding which expert to approach.</p>

<p>Each round, the expert’s (your) job is to diagnose the client’s problem and treat 
    them. You can either choose a low-quality treatment, or a high-quality treatment. 
    The low-quality treatment only solves the small problem of the client. The high-quality 
    treatment solves both the small problem and the big problem. You always have to pay 
    X Coins for the low-quality treatment, and Y Coins for the high-quality treatment.</p>

<p>Each round, clients (you) receive either a big problem with a probability of x%, or 
    a small problem with a probability of y%. You will never be informed about which 
    problem you actually have. In order to solve the problem, you need to approach an 
    expert. Alternatively, you (and all other clients) can also choose not to enter 
    the market, and avoid interacting with an expert. If you decide to enter the market, 
    you choose one of the 3 experts. If the chosen expert successfully solves your problem, 
    you receive 150 Coins for that round. If the problem is not solved, you receive nothing. 
    Irrespective of the outcome, you have to pay the treatment-price as chosen and posted by 
    the expert. All prices by each expert and each expert’s respective ability level are visible 
    to you when deciding which expert to approach.</p>

<p>Each round, the expert’s job is to diagnose the client’s problem and treat them. Experts can 
    either choose a low-quality treatment, or a high-quality treatment. The low-quality treatment 
    only solves the small problem of the client. The high-quality treatment solves both the small 
    problem and the big problem. Experts always have to pay X Coins for the low-quality treatment, 
    and Y Coins for the high-quality treatment.</p>
