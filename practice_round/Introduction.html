        <p>In this experiment, three experts interact with three clients. 
            You have been randomly assigned the role of client/expert. 
            Your role determines your decisions throughout the experiment. 
            However, to make informed choices that determine your bonus, you need 
            to understand both roles. Please click on the button below to proceed 
            to the instructions. Read them carefully, because you will need to 
            answer a few comprehension questions afterwards. During the instructions, 
            you will also complete a practice round to familiarize yourself with the decision environment.</p>

            <p>Thank you for participating in this experiment. Please stay attentive 
                until the end of the experiment and avoid any distractions. Because 
                you will continuously interact with your group members, is it essential 
                that you do not (a) leave this experiment or (b) take a longer pause. At 
                the top of every decision screen, you will see a countdown (example picture). 
                If you fail three times to make a decision within that time frame, we have to 
                assume that you left, and will therefore kick you from the experiment.</p>
            
            <p>During the study, your payoffs are stated in Coins. The exchange rate is: X</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>As stated before, there are two roles in this experiment: client and expert.  
                You have been randomly selected to be an expert. There are two types of expert. 
                A high-ability expert, and a low-ability expert. The probability that an expert 
                is a high-ability expert is x% and the probability that an expert is a low-ability 
                expert is y%. These probabilities are common knowledge, and clients also know them. 
                You have been randomly assigned to be a x expert. You keep that role for the entire 
                experiment. All clients can observe your ability level. The experiment consists of 
                25 rounds. In total, there are 3 clients and 3 experts.</p>
        </div>

        <input type="checkbox" id="title3" />
        <label for="title3">Experimental Procedure</label>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>Each round follows the same basic sequence of decisions. Be mindful that you need 
                to understand both roles in order to answer the comprehension questions and make 
                sensible decisions that determine your final bonus payoff.</p>
            
            <p>Each round, clients receive either a big problem with a probability of x%, 
                or a small problem with a probability of y%. Clients will never be informed 
                about which problem they actually have. In order to solve the problem, a client 
                needs to approach an expert. Alternatively, each client can also choose not to 
                enter the market, and avoid interaction with an expert. If a client decides to 
                enter the market, he or she can choose one of z experts. If the chosen expert 
                successfully solves the clientâ€™s problem, the client receives 150 Coins for that 
                round. If the problem is not solved, the client does not receive anything. 
                Irrespective of the outcome, the client has to pay the price chosen by the expert. 
                All prices by each expert and their respective ability level are visible to the 
                client when deciding which expert to approach.</p>
