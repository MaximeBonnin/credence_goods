    <div class="general-intro">
        <p>In this experiment, three experts interact with three clients. 
            You have been randomly assigned the role of client/expert. 
            Your role determines your decisions throughout the experiment. 
            However, to make informed choices that determine your bonus, you need 
            to understand both roles. Please click on the button below to proceed 
            to the instructions. Read them carefully, because you will need to 
            answer a few comprehension questions afterwards. During the instructions, 
            you will also complete a practice round to familiarize yourself with the decision environment.</p>
