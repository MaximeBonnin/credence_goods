<p>In this experiment, three experts interact with three clients. 
    You have been randomly assigned the role of client/expert. 
    Your role determines your decisions throughout the experiment. 
    However, to make informed choices that determine your bonus, you need 
    to understand both roles. Please click on the button below to proceed 
    to the instructions. Read them carefully, because you will need to 
    answer a few comprehension questions afterwards. During the instructions, 
    you will also complete a practice round to familiarize yourself with the decision environment.</p>

<p>Thank you for participating in this experiment. Please stay attentive 
    until the end of the experiment and avoid any distractions. Because 
    you will continuously interact with your group members, is it essential 
    that you do not (a) leave this experiment or (b) take a longer pause. At 
    the top of every decision screen, you will see a countdown (example picture). 
    If you fail three times to make a decision within that time frame, we have to 
    assume that you left, and will therefore kick you from the experiment.</p>

<p>During the study, your payoffs are stated in Coins. The exchange rate is: X</p>
