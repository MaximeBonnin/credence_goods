<p>At the beginning of each round, you set your prices. You choose between three price vectors. 
    Each price vector determines the price you will charge any client that approaches you, 
    depending on which treatment you choose. The three price vectors are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>P1: X</li>
    <li>P2: X</li>
    <li>P3: X</li>
</ul>
