{% if participant.is_expert %}
<p>After you set your prices, you will proceed with the diagnosis.  
    Remember that there are two types of expert, and you have been 
    selected to be a {% participant.ability_level %}-ability expert. When deciding which 
    expert to approach, the <b>clients can {% if not session.config.treatment_skill_visible %} not {% endif %} observe your and all other expert’s ability levels</b>. </p>

<p>As a {% participant.ability_level %}-ability expert, you will receive a signal in each round, that tells you which of 
    the two problems a client has. This signal is <b>{% C.EXPERT_ABILITY_LEVEL_TO_DIAGNOSIS_ACCURACY_PERCENT.low %}% accurate for the low-ability expert</b>{% if participant.ability_level == "low" %} (you){% endif %}, 
    and <b>{% C.EXPERT_ABILITY_LEVEL_TO_DIAGNOSIS_ACCURACY_PERCENT.high %}% accurate for the high-ability expert</b>{% if participant.ability_level == "high" %} (you){% endif %}. Thus, if e.g. a client has a small problem, 
    then, you get the signal that the problem is small with a probability of {% if participant.ability_level == "low" %}{% C.EXPERT_ABILITY_LEVEL_TO_DIAGNOSIS_ACCURACY_PERCENT.low %}{% else %}{% C.EXPERT_ABILITY_LEVEL_TO_DIAGNOSIS_ACCURACY_PERCENT.high %}{% endif %}%.</p>

<p>To receive the signal, you need to complete a short prediction task (see image below). 
    A client’s problem is determined by 4 symptoms, and as a 
    {% if participant.ability_level == "low" %}low-ability expert <b>you receive 2 input factors</b>. A high-ability expert receives 3{% else %}
    high-ability expert <b>you receive 3 input factors</b>. A low-ability expert receives 2{% endif %} input factors.
    To make your diagnosis, you only need to click on the blue diagnosis button. 
    You need to do nothing else. Afterwards, you will receive the diagnostic signal.</p>

<img src="" alt="prediction task">

<p>Finally, you decide which treatment you want to implement for a given client.</p>

<p>Importantly, you will diagnose and treat all {% C.NUM_CONSUMERS_PER_GROUP %} possible clients in each round. 
    However, your decisions will only affect your payoff if at least one client decided 
    to approach you. Then, <b>for each client that approached you, you will receive the price 
        associated with your chosen treatment for that client as payoff</b>. For example, if a client 
    approached you, and you decided to implement the high-quality treatment, you will receive 
    the price for the high-quality treatment as a payoff. <b>Remember however that you will also 
        need to pay the costs of the high-quality treatment</b>. If e.g. two clients approached you, 
    and you chose to implement the high-quality treatment for one and the low-quality treatment 
    for the other client, you will receive the price of 1 high-quality treatment and 1 low-quality 
    treatment as payoff, while also paying the costs of 1 high-quality treatment and 1 low-quality treatment.</p>

<p>After experts set their prices, they proceed with the diagnosis. Remember that there are two types 
    of expert, a low-ability and a high-ability expert. When deciding which expert to approach, <b>you 
        can {% if not session.config.treatment_skill_visible %} not {% endif %} observe each expert’s ability level</b>.</p>

<p>Experts receive a signal in each round, that tells them which of the two problems a client has. 
    This <b>signal is{% C.EXPERT_ABILITY_LEVEL_TO_DIAGNOSIS_ACCURACY_PERCENT.low %}% accurate for the low-ability expert, 
        and {% C.EXPERT_ABILITY_LEVEL_TO_DIAGNOSIS_ACCURACY_PERCENT.high %}% accurate for the high-ability expert</b>. 
    Thus, if e.g. you have a small problem, then, the high-ability experts gets the signal that the 
    problem is small with a probability of {% C.EXPERT_ABILITY_LEVEL_TO_DIAGNOSIS_ACCURACY_PERCENT.high %}%, and the low-ability expert gets the signal that the 
    problem is small with a probability of {% C.EXPERT_ABILITY_LEVEL_TO_DIAGNOSIS_ACCURACY_PERCENT.low %}%. Remember that you only receive the {% C.CONSUMER_PAYOFFS.problem_solved %} Coins if your 
    problem is solved. Additionally, once you approach an expert, you will have to pay for whatever 
    treatment the expert decided to implement.</p>


<p>To receive the signal, experts need to complete a short prediction task. The prediction task works 
    as follows: Your problem (small or big) is determined by 5 symptoms, which are assigned to you 
    randomly at the beginning of each round. The 5 symptoms determine whether you have a big or a 
    small problem. High-ability experts can observe three of your symptoms. Low-ability experts can 
    observe two of your symptoms. Therefore, high-ability experts are better at diagnosing you. Using 
    the symptoms, the expert makes a diagnosis and receives a diagnostic signal.</p>

<p>After making their diagnosis, each expert decides which treatment they want to implement for a given client. </p>

<p>If no client approaches an expert, the expert does not earn any money for that specific round.</p>
