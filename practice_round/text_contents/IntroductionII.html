<p> Please stay attentive
    until the end of the experiment and avoid any distractions. Because 
    you will continuously interact with your group members, is <b>it essential 
        that you do not (a) leave this experiment or (b) take a longer pause</b>. At 
    the top of every decision screen, you will see a countdown:</p>
<div class="img-container">
    <img src="{{ static 'timer.png' }}" alt="timer picture">
</div>
<p>If you fail three times to make a decision within that time frame, we have to
    assume that you left, and the system will automatically remove you from the experiment.
This allows the other players to continue with the task. Unfortunately, we cannot pay participants who are automatically removed
from the experiment. </p>
