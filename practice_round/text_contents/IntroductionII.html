<p>Thank you for participating in this experiment. Please stay attentive 
    until the end of the experiment and avoid any distractions. Because 
    you will continuously interact with your group members, is <b>it essential 
        that you do not (a) leave this experiment or (b) take a longer pause</b>. At

<p><b>If you fail three times to make a decision within that time frame, we have to 
    assume that you left, and will therefore kick you from the experiment.</b></p>
