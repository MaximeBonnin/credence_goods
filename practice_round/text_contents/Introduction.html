<p>In this experiment, three experts interact with three clients. 
    <b>You have been randomly assigned the role of {% if participant.is_expert %} expert{%else %} client{% endif %}</b>. 
    Your role determines your decisions throughout the experiment. 
    However, to make informed choices that determine your bonus, you need 
    to <b>understand both roles</b>. Please click on the button below to proceed 
    to the instructions. Read them carefully, because you will need to 
    answer a few comprehension questions afterwards. During the instructions, 
    you will also complete a practice round to familiarize yourself with the decision environment.</p>

<p>Thank you for participating in this experiment. Please stay attentive 
    until the end of the experiment and avoid any distractions. Because 
    you will continuously interact with your group members, is <b>it essential 
        that you do not (a) leave this experiment or (b) take a longer pause</b>. At 
    the top of every decision screen, you will see a countdown.</p>
<img src="" alt="example picture">
<p><b>If you fail three times to make a decision within that time frame, we have to 
    assume that you left, and will therefore kick you from the experiment.</b></p>

<p>During the study, your payoffs are stated in Coins. The <b>exchange rate is: {% session.config.real_world_currency_per_point %}</b></p>
