<p>Thank you for participating! In this experiment, {% C.NUM_EXPERTS_PER_GROUP %} experts interact with {% C.NUM_CONSUMERS_PER_GROUP %} clients.
    <b>You have been randomly assigned the role of {% if participant.is_expert %} expert{%else %} client{% endif %}</b>. 
    Your role determines your decisions throughout the experiment. 
    However, to make informed choices that determine your bonus, you need 
    to understand both roles. </p>

    <p> During the experiment, all your payoffs will be stated in Coins. At the end of the experiment, all your Coins will be
        converted into Dollars.</p>

    <p> The exchange rate is: {% session.config.real_world_currency_per_point %}. Thus 100 Coins = 1$ </p>


    <p> Please click on the button below to proceed
    to the instructions. Read them carefully, because you will need to 
    answer a few comprehension questions afterwards. During the instructions, 
    you will also complete a practice round to familiarize yourself with the decision environment.</p>
