<p>Each round follows the same basic sequence of decisions. </p>

<p>Each round, clients receive either a <b> big problem </b> with a probability of <b>{% C.CHANCE_TO_HAVE_LARGE_PROBLEM_IN_PERCENT %}%</b>,
    or a <b> small problem </b> with a probability of <b>{% C.CHANCE_TO_HAVE_SMALL_PROBLEM_IN_PERCENT %}%</b>. Clients will never be informed
    about which problem they actually have. </p>

<p> In order to solve the problem, a client
    needs to approach an expert. Clients can choose any one of the {% C.NUM_EXPERTS_PER_GROUP %} experts. If the chosen expert
        successfully solves the client’s problem, the client receives <b> {% C.CONSUMER_PAYOFFS.problem_solved %} Coins </b> for that
        round. If the problem is not solved, the client does not receive anything. Alternatively, each client can also choose to approach no expert, and earn an outside-payoff of 15 Coins. </p>

<p> Irrespective of whether the problem was solved, clients have to pay the price chosen by their expert.
    All prices by each expert are visible to the
    client when deciding which expert to approach.</p>

<p> Each round, the <b>expert’s (your) job is to diagnose the client’s problem and treat
    them</b>. You can either choose a low-quality treatment, or a high-quality treatment. 
    The low-quality treatment only solves the small problem of the client. The high-quality 
    treatment solves both the small problem and the big problem. You always have to pay 
    <b> {% C.COST_OF_PROVIDING_SMALL_SERVICE %} Coins </b> for the low-quality treatment, and <b> {% C.COST_OF_PROVIDING_LARGE_SERVICE %} Coins </b> for the high-quality treatment.</p>
