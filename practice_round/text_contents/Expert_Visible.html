    However, clients may be able to learn something about your ability type, based on their experience and your decision throughout this experiment. </p>
<p> Additionally, all clients know about the probabilities for each expert to be either of high-ability (50%) or low-ability (50%) type.</p>

<p>You cannot observe the ability level of any individual expert. You only know that for any expert,
    the probability that they are a high-ability expert is 50% and the probability that they are a low-ability expert is 50% </p>
<p> Additionally, you may be able to infer an expertâ€™s ability level by looking at their actions throughout the experiment. Experts know
    that you cannot see their ability.</p>
