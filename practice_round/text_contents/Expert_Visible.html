<p> Additionally, all clients know about the probabilities for each expert to be either of high-ability (1/3) or low-ability (2/3) type.</p>

<p>You cannot observe the ability level of any individual expert. You only know that for any expert,
    the probability that they are a high-ability expert is 1/3 and the probability that they are a low-ability expert is 2/3. </p>
<p> Additionally, you may be able to infer an expertâ€™s ability level by looking at their actions throughout the experiment. Experts know
    that you cannot see their ability.</p>
