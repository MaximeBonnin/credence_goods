<p>In this experiment, participants interact in groups of {% C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP %}. There are three roles:
<ul>
  <li>high-ability experts,</li>
  <li>low-ability experts,</li>
  <li>clients.</li>
</ul>

    A group consists of {% C.NUM_EXPERTS_PER_GROUP %} experts and {% C.NUM_CONSUMERS_PER_GROUP %} clients.
    Each expert has a 50% probability to be a high-ability expert, and a 50% probability to be a low-ability expert. Therefore, on average, there are 2 high-ability experts,
    2 low-ability experts, and 4 clients. </p>

<p> All participants are randomly assigned one role. They keep that role for the entirety of the experiment. The experiment consists of 25 rounds. </p>


<p> Your role determines your decisions throughout the experiment.
    However, to make informed choices that determine your bonus payoff, you need
    to understand both roles. </p>
