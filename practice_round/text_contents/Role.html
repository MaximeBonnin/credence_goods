<p>As stated before, there are two roles in this experiment: client and expert.  
    <b>You have been randomly selected to be an expert</b>. There are two types of expert. 
    A high-ability expert, and a low-ability expert. The probability that an expert 
    is a high-ability expert is 50% and the probability that an expert is a low-ability 
    expert is 50%. These probabilities are common knowledge, and clients also know them. 
    <b>You have been randomly assigned to be a {% participant.ability_level %}-ability expert</b>. You keep that role for the entire 
    experiment. All clients can observe your ability level. The experiment consists of 
    <b>25 rounds</b>. In total, there are {% C.NUM_CONSUMERS_PER_GROUP %} clients and {% C.NUM_EXPERTS_PER_GROUP %} experts.</p>

<p>As stated before, there are two roles in this experiment: client and expert.  
    <b>You have been randomly selected to be a client</b>. You keep that role for the entire 
    experiment. You will play within a group of {% C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP %} participants, {% C.NUM_CONSUMERS_PER_GROUP %} clients and {% C.NUM_EXPERTS_PER_GROUP %} experts. 
    There are two types of expert. A high-ability expert, and a low-ability expert. 
    For any expert, the probability that they are a high-ability expert is 50% and 
    the probability that they are a low-ability expert is 50%. You will always be 
    able to observe the ability level of each expert. Experts know that you can see their ability. The experiment consists of 
    <b>25 rounds</b>.

    Also, all clients know about the probabilities for each expert to be either of high-ability or low-ability type.

    There are two types of expert. A high-ability expert, and a low-ability expert. 
    However, you cannot observe the ability level of any expert.     
    You only know that for any expert, the probability that they are a high-ability expert is 50% and the probability that they are a low-ability expert is 50%.
    Additionally, you may be able to infer an expertâ€™s ability level by looking at their actions throughout the experiment.
    Experts know that you cannot see their ability. The experiment consists of <b>25 rounds</b>.
