<p>In this experiment, you are assigned to a group of {% C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP %} players. In this group, you make decisions for 25 rounds. Each player is randomly assigned one of three roles,
    which they keep for the entirety of the experiment:
<ul>
  <li>high-ability expert,</li>
  <li>low-ability expert,</li>
  <li>client.</li>
</ul>

    A group consists of {% C.NUM_EXPERTS_PER_GROUP %} experts and {% C.NUM_CONSUMERS_PER_GROUP %} clients.
    Out of the {% C.NUM_EXPERTS_PER_GROUP %} experts, 2 are randomly assigned to be a low-ability expert, and 1 to be a high-ability expert.</p>

<p> Your role determines your decisions throughout the experiment.
    However, to make informed choices that determine your bonus payoff, you need
    to understand both roles. </p>
