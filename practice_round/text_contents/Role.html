    <p> There are two types of expert.
    A high-ability expert, and a low-ability expert. The probability that an expert 
    is a high-ability expert is 50% and the probability that an expert is a low-ability 
    expert is 50%. These probabilities are common knowledge, and clients also know them. </p>
