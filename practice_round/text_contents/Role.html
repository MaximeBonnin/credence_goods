    <p>As stated before, there are two roles in this experiment: client and expert.
    You have been randomly selected to be an expert. </p>

    <p> There are two types of expert.
    A high-ability expert, and a low-ability expert. The probability that an expert 
    is a high-ability expert is 50% and the probability that an expert is a low-ability 
    expert is 50%. These probabilities are common knowledge, and clients also know them. </p>

    <p> <b>You have been randomly assigned to be a {% participant.ability_level %}-ability expert</b>. You keep that role for the entire
    experiment. All clients can observe your ability level, as well as the ability level of all other experts. </p>
    <p> The experiment consists of
    25 rounds. In total, there are {% C.NUM_CONSUMERS_PER_GROUP %} clients and {% C.NUM_EXPERTS_PER_GROUP %} experts.</p>

    There are two types of expert. A high-ability expert, and a low-ability expert.

    <p> You will always be
