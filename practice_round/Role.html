{% if participant.is_expert %}
<p>As stated before, there are two roles in this experiment: client and expert.  
    You have been randomly selected to be an expert. There are two types of expert. 
    A high-ability expert, and a low-ability expert. The probability that an expert 
    is a high-ability expert is 50% and the probability that an expert is a low-ability 
    expert is 50%. These probabilities are common knowledge, and clients also know them. 
    You have been randomly assigned to be a x expert. You keep that role for the entire 
    experiment. All clients can observe your ability level. The experiment consists of 
    25 rounds. In total, there are {% C.NUM_CONSUMERS_PER_GROUP %} clients and {% C.NUM_EXPERTS_PER_GROUP %} experts.</p>
