                    <p>In this experiment, three experts interact with three clients. 
                        You have been randomly assigned the role of client/expert. 
                        Your role determines your decisions throughout the experiment. 
                        However, to make informed choices that determine your bonus, you need 
                        to understand both roles. Please click on the button below to proceed 
                        to the instructions. Read them carefully, because you will need to 
                        answer a few comprehension questions afterwards. During the instructions, 
                        you will also complete a practice round to familiarize yourself with the decision environment.</p>
            
                    <p>Thank you for participating in this experiment. Please stay attentive 
                        until the end of the experiment and avoid any distractions. Because 
                        you will continuously interact with your group members, is it essential 
                        that you do not (a) leave this experiment or (b) take a longer pause. At 
                        the top of every decision screen, you will see a countdown (example picture). 
                        If you fail three times to make a decision within that time frame, we have to 
                        assume that you left, and will therefore kick you from the experiment.</p>

                        <p>As stated before, there are two roles in this experiment: client and expert.  
                            You have been randomly selected to be an expert. There are two types of expert. 
                            A high-ability expert, and a low-ability expert. The probability that an expert 
                            is a high-ability expert is 50% and the probability that an expert is a low-ability 
                            expert is 50%. These probabilities are common knowledge, and clients also know them. 
                            You have been randomly assigned to be a x expert. You keep that role for the entire 
                            experiment. All clients can observe your ability level. The experiment consists of 
                            25 rounds. In total, there are {% C.NUM_CONSUMERS_PER_GROUP %} clients and {% C.NUM_EXPERTS_PER_GROUP %} experts.</p>

                        <p>Each round follows the same basic sequence of decisions. Be mindful that you need 
                            to understand both roles in order to answer the comprehension questions and make 
                            sensible decisions that determine your final bonus payoff.</p>
                        
                        <p>Each round, clients receive either a big problem with a probability of x%, 
                            or a small problem with a probability of y%. Clients will never be informed 
                            about which problem they actually have. In order to solve the problem, a client 
                            needs to approach an expert. Alternatively, each client can also choose not to 
                            enter the market, and avoid interaction with an expert. If a client decides to 
                            enter the market, he or she can choose one of z experts. If the chosen expert 
                            successfully solves the client’s problem, the client receives 150 Coins for that 
                            round. If the problem is not solved, the client does not receive anything. 
                            Irrespective of the outcome, the client has to pay the price chosen by the expert. 
                            All prices by each expert and their respective ability level are visible to the 
                            client when deciding which expert to approach.</p>
            
                        <p>Each round, the expert’s (your) job is to diagnose the client’s problem and treat 
                            them. You can either choose a low-quality treatment, or a high-quality treatment. 
                            The low-quality treatment only solves the small problem of the client. The high-quality 
                            treatment solves both the small problem and the big problem. You always have to pay 
                            X Coins for the low-quality treatment, and Y Coins for the high-quality treatment.</p>

                        <p>At the beginning of each round, you set your prices. You choose between three price vectors. 
                            Each price vector determines the price you will charge any client that approaches you, 
                            depending on which treatment you choose. The three price vectors are:</p>

                        <p>After you set your prices, you will proceed with the diagnosis.  
                            Remember that there are two types of expert, and you have been 
                            selected to be a low-ability/high-ability expert. When deciding which 
                            expert to approach, the clients can [NOT] observe your and all other expert’s ability levels. </p>
            
                        <p>As a low/high-ability expert, you will receive a signal in each round, that tells you which of 
                            the two problems a client has. This signal is x% accurate for the low-ability expert (you), 
                            and y% accurate for the high-ability expert (you). Thus, if e.g. a client has a small problem, 
                            then, you get the signal that the problem is small with a probability of x/y%.</p>
            
                        <p>To receive the signal, you need to complete a short prediction task (see image below). 
                            A client’s problem is determined by 4 symptoms, and as a low/high-ability expert, 
                            you receive 2/3 input factors. A high/low-ability receives 3/2 input factors. 
                            To make your diagnosis, you only need to click on the blue diagnosis button. 
                            You need to do nothing else. Afterwards, you will receive the diagnostic signal.</p>
            
                        <p>Finally, you decide which treatment you want to implement for a given client.</p>
            
                        <p>Importantly, you will diagnose and treat all X possible clients in each round. 
                            However, your decisions will only affect your payoff if at least one client decided 
                            to approach you. Then, for each client that approached you, you will receive the price 
                            associated with your chosen treatment for that client as payoff. For example, if a client 
                            approached you, and you decided to implement the high-quality treatment, you will receive 
                            the price for the high-quality treatment as a payoff. Remember however that you will also 
                            need to pay the costs of the high-quality treatment. If e.g. two clients approached you, 
                            and you chose to implement the high-quality treatment for one and the low-quality treatment 
                            for the other client, you will receive the price of 1 high-quality treatment and 1 low-quality 
                            treatment as payoff, while also paying the costs of 1 high-quality treatment and 1 low-quality treatment.</p>
                            
                        <p>If either no client approached you, or no client entered the market, you do not earn any additional payoff. </p>

                            problem is small with a probability of y%. Remember that you only receive the 150 Coins if your 
                            problem is solved. Additionally, once you approach an expert, you will have to pay for whatever 
                            treatment the expert decided to implement.</p>

                        <p>To receive the signal, experts need to complete a short prediction task. The prediction task works 
                            as follows: Your problem (small or big) is determined by 5 symptoms, which are assigned to you 
                            randomly at the beginning of each round. The 5 symptoms determine whether you have a big or a 
                            small problem. High-ability experts can observe three of your symptoms. Low-ability experts can 
                            observe two of your symptoms. Therefore, high-ability experts are better at diagnosing you. Using 
                            the symptoms, the expert makes a diagnosis and receives a diagnostic signal.</p>
                        
                        <p>After making their diagnosis, each expert decides which treatment they want to implement for a given client. </p>

                        <p>If no client approaches an expert, the expert does not earn any money for that specific round.</p>
