<p>After you set your prices, you will proceed with the diagnosis.  
    Remember that there are two types of expert, and you have been 
    selected to be a low-ability/high-ability expert. When deciding which 
    expert to approach, the clients can [NOT] observe your and all other expert’s ability levels. </p>

<p>As a low/high-ability expert, you will receive a signal in each round, that tells you which of 
    the two problems a client has. This signal is x% accurate for the low-ability expert (you), 
    and y% accurate for the high-ability expert (you). Thus, if e.g. a client has a small problem, 
    then, you get the signal that the problem is small with a probability of x/y%.</p>

<p>To receive the signal, you need to complete a short prediction task (see image below). 
    A client’s problem is determined by 4 symptoms, and as a low/high-ability expert, 
    you receive 2/3 input factors. A high/low-ability receives 3/2 input factors. 
    To make your diagnosis, you only need to click on the blue diagnosis button. 
    You need to do nothing else. Afterwards, you will receive the diagnostic signal.</p>

<p>Finally, you decide which treatment you want to implement for a given client.</p>

<p>Importantly, you will diagnose and treat all X possible clients in each round. 
    However, your decisions will only affect your payoff if at least one client decided 
    to approach you. Then, for each client that approached you, you will receive the price 
    associated with your chosen treatment for that client as payoff. For example, if a client 
    approached you, and you decided to implement the high-quality treatment, you will receive 
    the price for the high-quality treatment as a payoff. Remember however that you will also 
    need to pay the costs of the high-quality treatment. If e.g. two clients approached you, 
    and you chose to implement the high-quality treatment for one and the low-quality treatment 
    for the other client, you will receive the price of 1 high-quality treatment and 1 low-quality 
    treatment as payoff, while also paying the costs of 1 high-quality treatment and 1 low-quality treatment.</p>
