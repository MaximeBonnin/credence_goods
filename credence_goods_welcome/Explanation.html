        <p>This experiment will take about 45 minutes to complete.</p>

        <p>In this experiment there will be two roles: <b>Experts</b> and <b>Consumers</b>. You will be assigned one of these roles at random.
        Once you have your role, you get more detailled information about what you will do.</p>

        <p>In general terms, Consumers will have <b>large or small Problems</b> and Experts will be able to solve them.
        However, Experts may not be honest about their diagnosis of the problem and provide innappropriate services. This can result
        in the Consumers' problem not being solved or in providing more services than needed.</p>

        <p>You will have <b>Coins</b> that you can earn and spend. They will be exchanged for real currency after the experiment ends. 
        It is possible to have a negative balance of Coins, however you will <b>always be paid</b> after the experiment.</p>
