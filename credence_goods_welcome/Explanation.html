            <p>Welcome! In this experiment, you will be matched with <span class="num_other_players"></span> other participants.
                You will interact with these <span class="num_other_players"></span> other players over the course of many rounds, 
                and your group will always stay the same. It is therefore very important that 
                you <b>only accept this experiment if you are able to complete it without any interruption</b>, 
                and if you are certain that you will stay over the whole course of the experiment, 
                which will take about <b>45 minutes</b>. </p>
    
            <p>In addition to the base payment of {% session.config.participation_fee %}, you will be able to earn an <b> additional
                 bonus that is substantially higher</b> than your base payment. This additional bonus
                 will depend on your actions, as explained in the instructions you will receive
                 after this page. </p>
    
            <p>If you are certain that you can complete this experiment without any interruptions, 
                click the button below to receive your role and proceed to your role-specific instructions. </p>
    
            <p>Please also note that you will only be able to proceed to the full experiment after correctly 
                answering a number of comprehension questions. <b>You need to answer them correctly within 3 <!-- HARDCODED --> trials</b>, 
                otherwise, you will be barred from participating. If you read the instructions carefully, you 
                wonâ€™t have any issues with them.</p>
    
            <p>Once you complete the comprehension questions, you will be forwarded to a waiting room.
                Here, you will be matched with your <span class="num_other_players"></span> other participants. Once the matching procedure has 
                completed, you will need to confirm that you want to proceed with the experiment <b>within 30 seconds </b>.
                It is thus very important that you are attentive while waiting.</p>
