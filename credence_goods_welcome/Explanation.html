        <p>Welcome! In this experiment, you will be matched with 5 <!-- HARDCODED --> other participants.
            You will interact with these 5 <!-- HARDCODED --> other players over the course of many rounds, 
            and your group will always stay the same. It is therefore very important that 
            you <b>only accept this experiment if you are able to complete it without any interruption</b>, 
            and if you are certain that you will stay over the whole course of the experiment, 
            which will take about <b>45 minutes</b>. </p>

        <p>In addition to the base payment of <b>x <!-- HARDCODED --> Pound</b>, you will be able to earn an additional
             bonus that is <b>substantially higher</b> than you base payment. This additional bonus 
             will depend on your actions, as explained on the instructions you will receive 
             after this page. </p>

        <p>If you are certain that you can complete this experiment without any interruptions, 
            click the button below to receive your role and proceed to your role-specific instructions. </p>

        <p>Please also note that you will only be able to proceed to the full experiment after correctly 
            answering a number of comprehension questions. <b>You need to answer them correctly within Y <!-- HARDCODED --> trials</b>, 
            otherwise, you will be barred from participating. If you read the instructions carefully, you 
            wonâ€™t have any issues with them.</p>

        <p>Once you completed the comprehension questions, you will be forwarded to a waiting room. 
            Here, you will be matched with your 5 <!-- HARDCODED --> other participants. Once the matching procedure has 
            completed, you will need to confirm that you want to proceed with the experiment within 30 seconds. 
            It is thus very important that you are attentive while waiting.</p>

        <p>If you are ready, please press the button below to proceed to the waiting room.</p>
